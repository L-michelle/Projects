* Performed ad-hoc analysis of how many customers churned that streamed movies.
* Created pivot tables and visualizations to answer questions.
* Concluded that those who churned that streamed movies had a higher monthly charge and higher tenure.
* When looking at contract term per gender, males and females were split pretty evenly amongst all the three offered plans.
* Also found that those who pay with a mailed check paid significantly less than those who used other means of payment methods available.
