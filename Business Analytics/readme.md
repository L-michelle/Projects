# Business Analytics (Marketing Expenses Optimization)

This project analyzes the dataset from Yandex.Afisha. The purpose of this analysis is to make reports and calculate metrics. Such metrics include user behavior, LTV, cohort analysis, and return on investment (ROI) of advertising expenses. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA was performed. We found that user engagement is low (short sessions, summer drop-off) and needs improvement, possibly through UI/UX design. While there are purchases (highest in November, lowest in May), overall ROI is negative and ad costs are high. We recommend analyzing high-performing ad sources and user acquisition strategies (like those used for September cohort) to improve ROI and consider seasonal promotions to address summer sales slump.
