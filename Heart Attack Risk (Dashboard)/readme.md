# Heart Attack Risk
The data was cleaned in a jupyter notebook environment using Python and visualized in Tableau. This project was also the winner of a data visualization challenge with TripleTen in December of 2023. 

Project Goal: Identify factors contributing to heart attack risk across various countries.

Findings:
* Dataset skewed towards males, and all males report smoking (potential data bias).
* Higher prevalence of risk factors in Nigeria, US, Germany, UK, Australia, and Argentina.
* Average systolic blood pressure identified as a significant indicator.
* No single factor solely responsible for heart attacks.

Conclusion/ Recommendations: While various factors contribute to heart attacks/heart disease, no single activity is solely responsible. Additionally, the data is limited to certain countries, and a larger sample size would be beneficial for more conclusive results. Incorporating gene-specific conditions alongside overall family history could further refine risk assessment.
