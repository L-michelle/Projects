# Food Product Analysis (A/A/B Testing and Funnel Analysis)

This analysis is for a startup that sells food products. I will investigate user behavior for the company's app and study the sales funnel. I will find out how many users reach each stage. The users for the A/A/B test are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. I will then look at the results of an A/A/B test to help determine whether or not to change the fonts for the entire app.
