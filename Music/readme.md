## Music App Analysis <a id='intro'></a>
In this project, we will compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. We'll study real Yandex.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.

### Goal: 
Test three hypotheses:
1. User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city. 
2. On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings. 
3. Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.
