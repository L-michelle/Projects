# Gym Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data. Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. In this project, we will analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.
We will:
- Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
- Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
- Analyze the factors that impact churn most
- Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
  1. Identify target groups
  2. Suggest measures to cut churn
  3. Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers
