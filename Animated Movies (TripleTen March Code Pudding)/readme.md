# Animated Movies

Contributed to a collaborative team project to showcase data visualization and communication skills. Utilized Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment for data cleaning and initial exploratory analysis, extracting key insights. Leveraged insights to construct data visualizations in Tableau, effectively communicating the findings to audience. This project not only highlighted my proficiency in Tableau but also demonstrated my ability to collaborate effectively within a team setting.
