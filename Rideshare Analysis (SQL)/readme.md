# Rideshare Analysis (SQL)

For this project, I worked as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. I analyzed the data using SQL and python to find patterns in the available information. I also wanted to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. I studied a database, analyzed data from competitors, and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
