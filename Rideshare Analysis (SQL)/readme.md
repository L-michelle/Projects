# Rideshare Analysis (SQL)

For this project, I am working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. I will analyze the data using SQL and python to find patterns in the available information. I also want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. I will study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
