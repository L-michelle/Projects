# Loyalty Program Analysis

This analysis is for a building material retailer called Homeworld. We were tasked to determine if the loyalty program helped boost purchased when it was introduced. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA was performed. The total revenue for a total of 30 shops were examined along with revenue from loyalty and non-loyalty members. Cohort analysis revealed a high churn rate in the first week, some positive churn in the 4th week, then a very high negative churn rate in the 8th week. Overall, the loyalty program did not improve or boost sales.
