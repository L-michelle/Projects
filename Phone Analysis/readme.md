# Phone Plan Analysis - Megaline 2018

You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

This project analyzes two different prepaid plans for Megaline- Surf and Ultimate. The goal is to find which plan brings in the most revenue so that Megaline can adjust the advertising budget. 
First, we will preprocess the data sets, analyze the users' behavior, then determine which plan brings in more revenue.
